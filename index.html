            Portability: Devices/nodes connected within the mobile computing system should facilitate mobility. These
            devices may have limited device capabilities and limited power supply but should have a sufficient
            processing capability and physical portability to operate in a movable environment.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="Common Devices">
        <p>
            Portable computers, compact, lightweight units including a full character set keyboard and primarily
            intended as hosts for software that may be parameterized, such as laptops/desktops, smartphones/tablets,
            etc.
            Smart cards that can run multiple applications but are typically used for payment, travel, and secure area
            access.
            Mobile phones, telephony devices which can call from a distance through cellular networking technology.
            Wearable computers, mostly limited to functional keys and primarily intended as the incorporation of
            software agents, such as bracelets, key-less implants, etc.

            Mobile security has become increasingly important in mobile computing. It is of particular concern as it
            relates to the security of personal information now stored on the smartphone. Mobile applications might copy
            user data from these devices to a remote server without the users’ permission and often without the users’
            consent.
            More and more users and businesses use smartphones as a means of planning and organizing their work and
            private life. Within companies, these technologies are causing profound changes in the organization of
            information systems and therefore they have become the source of new risks. Indeed, smartphones collect and
            compile an increasing amount of sensitive information to which access must be controlled to protect the
            privacy of the user and the intellectual property of the company.

        Several categories of portable computing devices can run on batteries but are not usually classified as laptops:
        portable computers, PDAs, ultra mobile PCs (UMPCs), tablets, and smartphones.
        A portable computer (discontinued) is a general-purpose computer that can be easily moved from place to place,
        but cannot be used while in transit, usually because it requires some "setting-up" and an AC power source. The
        most famous example is Osborne 1. Portable computers are also called a "transportable" or a "luggable" PC.
        A personal digital assistant (PDA) (discontinued) is a small, usually pocket-sized, computer with limited
        functionality. It is intended to supplement and to synchronize with a desktop computer, giving access to
        contacts, address book, notes, e-mail, and other features.

        A Palm TX PDA
        An ultra mobile PC (discontinued) is a full-featured, PDA-sized computer running a general-purpose operating
        system.
        Tablets/phones: a slate tablet is shaped like a paper notebook. Smartphones are the same devices as tablets,
        however, the only difference with smartphones is that they are much smaller and pocketable. Instead of a
        physical keyboard, these devices have a touchscreen including a combination of a virtual keyboard but can also
        link to a physical keyboard via wireless Bluetooth or USB. These devices include features other computer systems
        would not be able to incorporate, such as built-in cameras, because of their portability - although some laptops
        possess camera integration, and desktops and laptops can connect to a webcam by way of USB.
        A carputer is installed in an automobile. It operates as a wireless computer, sound system, GPS, and DVD player.
        It also contains word processing software and is Bluetooth compatible.[8]
        A Pentop (discontinued) is a computing device the size and shape of a pen. It functions as a writing utensil,
        MP3 player, language translator, digital storage device, and calculator.[9]
        An application-specific computer is one that is tailored to a particular application. For example, Ferranti
        introduced a handheld application-specific mobile computer (the MRT-100) in the form of a clipboard for
        conducting opinion polls.[
